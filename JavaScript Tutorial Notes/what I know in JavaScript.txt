1) Data types & Variables

var, let , const


2) Declaring variables (var a;)


3) Initializing variables (initialsing means var a = 2;)


4) Uninitailising variables (means not set to anything)


5) camelcase (declaration and assignment both should match)     


6)Adding Numbers


7)Substraction Number


8) Multiplaication of Numbers


9) Divsision of Numbers


10)  Incrementing Numbers


11) Incrementing myvar (myvar++;) & Decrmenting myvar  (myvar--;)


12) Decimal Numbers (Anything has a point in it)


13) Multiplying Decimals (2.0 * 2.0)


14) Divide Decimals (10.0 / 2.1)


15) Finding a Reminder (if you divide a number by 2 and remainder is zero then the number is even) 
    (var remainder = 20 % 2;)


16) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED ADDITION (+=)

                         var a=3;

    normal way           var a = a + 2;

    augmented addition   a += 2;


17) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED  SUBSTRACTION (-=)


18) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED MULTIPLICATION (*=)


19) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED DIVISION (/=)


20) DECLARE STRING VARIABLES 

    //example

    var firstName = "Alan" 



21) ESCAPING LITERAL QUOTES IN STRINGS

    \escp character to put before quotation marks

    means no longer last character

    var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes"";


22) QUOTING STRINGS WITH SINGLE QUOTES

   var myStr = "<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>;

                                        or

   var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">link</a>';

   single' can also be used to escape instead of \ or we can alos use back text `` at beginging and ending.
   by doing so we can use both single & Double quote



23) ESCAPE SEQUENCE IN STRINGS


     \' single quote

     \" double quote

     \\ backslash

     \b backspace

     \t tab

     \n newline

     \r carraiage return

     \f form feed


     example  // var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";

     ** first line then , new line, tab, then second line, then third line.



24) CONCATENATING STRINGS WITH PLUS OPERATOR

     var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."
     console.log(myStr);


25) CONCATENATING STRINGS WITH PLUS EQUAL OPERATOR

    var ourStr = "I come first. ";
    ourStr += "I come second. ";
