1) Data types & Variables

var, let , const


2) Declaring variables (var a;)


3) Initializing variables (initialsing means var a = 2;)


4) Uninitailising variables (means not set to anything)


5) camelcase (declaration and assignment both should match)     


6)Adding Numbers


7)Substraction Number


8) Multiplaication of Numbers


9) Divsision of Numbers


10)  Incrementing Numbers


11) Incrementing myvar (myvar++;) & Decrmenting myvar  (myvar--;)


12) Decimal Numbers (Anything has a point in it)


13) Multiplying Decimals (2.0 * 2.0)


14) Divide Decimals (10.0 / 2.1)


15) Finding a Reminder (if you divide a number by 2 and remainder is zero then the number is even) 
    (var remainder = 20 % 2;)


16) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED ADDITION (+=)

                         var a=3;

    normal way           var a = a + 2;

    augmented addition   a += 2;


17) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED  SUBSTRACTION (-=)


18) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED MULTIPLICATION (*=)


19) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED DIVISION (/=)


20) DECLARE STRING VARIABLES 

    //example

    var firstName = "Alan"
